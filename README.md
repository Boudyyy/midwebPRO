# Esports Team Registration 
At the end of a march, KTMU announcent they've allocated 20.000$ for cybersports deveopment, and a local tournament was going to take place. 

The winner would become a representative of KTMU in a particular esports discipline. 

This initiative later was supported by other universities, which made me and my friends think, there was an esports tournament between universities.

This project is all about me, fantasizing, how would it look, if anything like that would have been done at our University.
This is my view of how could a Dota 2 team registration look like.
