# Esports Team Registration 
At the end of a march, KTMU announcent they've allocated 20.000$ for cybersports deveopment, and a local tournament was going to take place. 

The winner would become a representative of KTMU in a particular esports discipline. 

This initiative later was supported by other universities, which made me and my friends think, there was an esports tournament between universities.

This project is all about me, fantasizing, how would it look, if anything like that would have been done at our University.
This is my personal view of how could a Dota 2 team registration look like.

The overall view of a project can be observed in a following picture :

We have a little 'Save' button at the left-bottom corner, which allows us to, obviously, save the entered data in a database.

And once the data is entered and saved, It all appears in a list:

If we don't like the information on the list, or we need it no more, it is very easy to delete it by pressing one button:

And that is pretty much it! Thanks for your attention!
